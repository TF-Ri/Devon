# Aurora Cord & Cable Company Enclosure

## Overview
A rugged white industrial enclosure manufactured by Aurora Cord & Cable Company. The unit features a large viewing window (possibly for an indicator light or display), a smaller square window (possibly for a photocell or solar sensor), and a lever-operated switch or valve mechanism. This appears to be a marine/industrial-grade junction box, fiber optic splice enclosure, or signaling device. The heavy-duty construction with multiple screws and gasket sealing suggests outdoor or harsh-environment deployment.

- Sealed cable entry points for external connections
- Viewing window for status indication without opening
- Lever switch for manual control
- Robust mounting options

## Potential Development Projects
1. **Outdoor Sensor Enclosure**: Repurpose as a waterproof housing for environmental sensors (weather station, air quality)
2. **Marine Electronics Box**: Use for waterproof marine electronics (GPS, fish finder display, navigation lights)
3. **Industrial IoT Gateway Housing**: Mount an IoT gateway board inside for outdoor deployment
4. **Remote Status Indicator**: Install LEDs visible through the window for remote equipment status monitoring
5. **Fiber Optic Splice Point**: If originally a fiber enclosure, use for fiber optic cable management and splicing

## Getting Started

### Required Tools
- Phillips screwdriver set for case screws
- Multimeter for testing any internal wiring
- Cable glands (if adding new cable entries)
- Silicone sealant for re-sealing after modification

### Initial Setup
1. Open the enclosure by removing the perimeter screws
2. Inspect internal contents (wiring, components, mounting points)
3. Document the internal layout and any existing connections
4. Plan the internal component layout for your project
5. Re-seal with original gasket when closing
